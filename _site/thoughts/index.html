" id="designing-public-health-surveillance-2022-11-06"><h1>Designing Public Health Surveillance</h1>
<p><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@seabbs">@seabbs</a> started a very thought provoking thread <sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> on mastodon the other day. It only came to my attention today (because I haven't yet figured out the whole timeline thing). The entire contents of the post are located <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@seabbs/109286050098017175">here</a> in which he asks what should the role of academics be in designing public health surveillance and outbreak response systems. He asks all the right question along the line of are academics (including PhD students, post-docs, early career researchers, etc) the right people to be designing these systems and/or the tools to respond to them. Are the incentives and expertise aligned (e.g., who funds whom and how are careers made). It is a real problem and an open question for public health and academic on how to organize on this topic. It is further compounded by the fact that there are other partners in this dance. There are normal funding goverment mechanisms, extra/intra-mural funders, NGOs (e.g., like Wellcome, Gates, GAVI, CEPI, among others) and the brass tacks of promotion, compensation, and ego.</p>
<p>In the absense of clear defintions, it seems that governments and large NGOs turn to consultants to figure these things out. Some examples are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/coronavirus-leading-through-the-crisis/covid-19-response-tool-hub">here</a>, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Navigating%20the%20coronavirus%20crisis%20collected%20works/Path-to-the-next-normal-collection.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/services/covid-19-consulting-resources-for-leaders.html">here</a>, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mckinsey-is-making-100-million-and-counting-advising-on-the-governments-bumbling-coronavirus-response">this one</a>, and had a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/22/private-consultants-vaccination-drive-outsourced/">strong response in vaccination planning</a>. And there are even <a href="https://www.thepublichealthco.com/">for profit companies that have sprung up to work on these topics</a>. Consultants can promise results and use their own people and "expertise" to focus on strategy while these agencies might be understaffed/ occupied with keeping the day-to-day going. Consultants are trained to cut through internal bureaucracy. For someone looking for a quick fix, consultants promise a result (and you pay them the big bucks to get it). At the end of the engagement and lots of meets, you get a really fancy presentation, and maybe even an excel spreadsheet "model." However, as is often case, the major problem is that the consultants don't stick around to see their recommendation implemented and aren't on the hook if the recommendations don't work (because of course they can't be carried out to the letter for mundane reasons and thus they are never implemented in full giving plausible deniability).</p>
<p>My comments back to <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@seabbs">@seabbs</a> and current thinking is that the solution to this problem must really be solutions. There is likely no one-size-fits-all solution to the question of outbreak response and surveillance. What works in the UK with the NHS will likely not work in the southern United States which might not work in central Peru or the Gambia. The local dynamics shapes a lot of what can be done. These feelings are shaped by two experiences-- leading benchmarking for North America for a multinational company and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of a non-profit health system. </p>
<p>When working with colleagues across the world to benchmark processes and procedures, I quickly learned that there were reasons why certain things could not work. Some of them appeared silly, but they were real obstacles. It could be how people were organized (e.g., management structures), technical (e.g., IT systems), and even legal nuances of a given country or city. While a recommendation appeared reasonable at first glance, when digging into the minutia it would fail miserably without accounting for these differences. This was often the case working with consultants who certainly never dug into these details and didn't stick around to help with implementation<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>. Similarly, the brilliant and driven <em>stagiaires</em> from the <em>grandes ecoles</em> often had amazing ideas, developed brilliant models, and pushes all of us failed most of their projects for a lack of appreciate of the local systems (which to be fair they couldn't get with their often abbreviated project timelines). While the spirit of different systems and approaches can be shared, very few things are plug and play without modification to the local terrain. </p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, differences in different systems was very apparent. Following the world-class science and analysis out of the UK, I couldn't help but be jealous of the surveillance systems available to scientists there. In the United States public health is decentralised to the individual states. Then within a given state, the counties have a large degree of lattitude over local health ordinances. Further still, public health departments don't often provide health care. Providing health care falls to a mixture of non-profit and for-profit hospitals, free clinics, and cash/free clinics. These providers span administrative boundaries (e.g., my system primarily served patients in two states and four to five counties). Data flowed to the state public health department and on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the local health department didn't have the capacity to run testing operations, so our system did. With our entire data science department we stood up all kinds of sophisticated <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.20190876v1">outbreak detection systems</a> and <a href="https://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/82/4/284">targetted deployment</a> of mobile testing resources (i.e., a van that could show up in a community and offer testing). All of this was made possible by being able to link testing results, outcomes, and adminstrative data to very rich electronic health records. Then the state contracted another set of venders to expand testing (which was good, widespread testing and lower result times were great) which led reduced coverage in our surveillance, outbreak detection, and targetted education program because they didn't share the data and the official goverment offices only provided aggregated data back. Furthermore, for the targetted outreach to work, we had to meet with community leaders (which included church leaders, leaders of special communities, and civic leaders). We also developed some very sophicated modelling approaches to inform local leaders to our projects. This included <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.07.21251291v1">modelling variants</a> starting with Alpha then Delta and Omicron afterwards.<sup><a href="#" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> Eventually the CDC started to post projections of cases and hospitalization, but our models were often better because of more detailed data and were more reflective of how care was actually provided locally.</p>
<p>So back to the question at hand. What do we need and where do academics fit in? I think this might not be the right formulation for the problem. If the question is how does one design and maintain a disease surveillance and outbreak detection system what skills and profiles should be involved? I think the most important consideration is that the people who will run the systems day to day have to be involved. The majority of the team cannot be temporary (even the two year secondments or post-docs)--they have to live with the results and resolve the issues. Then you'll need expertise. This is where the academics at all levels can come in. How many people do we need to sample? What are the changepoint detection methods we should use? All of this is tempered by the people with experience. Even if we detect a change how does that inform practice? What information is needed in order to make changes? What is truly relevant? What data do we actually have? What information could we get? This also helps with all of the context dependent questions about jurisdiction as well. Furthermore, integration of the people actually providing the care, doing the testing, running the vaccination schemes is important. The "boots on the group" often have additional insight and are critical for operationalizing programs. The next critical piece is that these groups need work on this work for a prolonged period of time measured in years and not months. The problem with temporary "fly-in" solutions is that they "fly-out." If you have to live with a solution for five years or more, you start thinking differently. I think if we started to think (and fund) along these lines, we might have better results. Rather than trying to develop the next best thing, we could implement and integrate the current best thing, well, with the right people and dedicated resources for the length of time required. When we're looking for universal solution and the next best algorithm for the next paper or grant proposal, I feel like we are setting ourselves up for a sub-optimum solution.</p>

<p>I was listening to the <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5jYXB0aXZhdGUuZm0vbGVhcm5iYXllc3N0YXRzLw?ep=14">learning Bayesian statistics podcast</a> in which the host interview <a href="http://bois.caltech.edu/">Justin Bois</a> of Cal Tech.<br />
When listening to how Justin came into statistics from chemical engineering (a story similar to my own), I was struck with how natural the transition from engineering is to Bayes..<br />
My first serious introduction to applied statistics was through projects designed to identify process variation.<br />
The experienced engineers all taught me that variation is natural, something you want to reduce in manufacturing, but never something that could be eliminated.<br />
That comfort with not having a fixed number led to higher comfort with probabilistic reasoning.<br />
More to write on this later.</p></section><section tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label=" Moving to mastodon

<p>So Elon bought Twitter.<br />
I have always been a bit ambivalent about using platforms in which I am the product.<br />
In some cases the ends justify the means, but someone who outwardly endorses things I am vehemently against is something of which I will not put.<br />

<p>Not too much to say on this topic other than I think that is is my new favorite tool.</p>
<p>Modules allow you to better encapsulate code by placing subdirectories in their own repository.<br />
These can then be added using the :</p>
<pre><code>git submodule add URL</code></pre>
<p>Then you can be off to the races.<br />
This also solves some of the problems with trying to deploy websites at a subdomain using a third party service</p></section><section tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label=" drawing blobs

<p>A long time ago now someone I deepely respect told me I ought to learn some PHP.<br />
I didn't.<br />
However, this website rendering engine is in pretty simple (but simple doesn't mean unelegant) PHP code.<br />
The way the initial code is written, if a given post has a non-date name (e.g., <code>YYYY-MM-DD-something.md</code>) the current code would strip the file extension but leave the remaining letters.<br />
When PHP tries to convert these to a date it fails and returns the begining of PHP time (Jan 1, 1970).<br />
I ended up fixing the code for my use by just <code>substr</code>ing the first ten characters and all is well.<br />
However, that's the point of this post.<br />
Once you have fluency in one or more programming language, especially general purpose ones, you can move in different waters.<br />
You at least have an idea of what the idiom is and what to look for and often that makes all of the difference.</p></section><section tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label=" Justfiles are cool

<p>I have to say that justfile might be my new favourite multi-lingual build tool.<br />
They allow you to use multiple languages within instructions, variables, are less sensitive to tabs, and have some really nice documentation.</p>
<p>For example a justfile that looks like:</p>
<pre><code># build docs
build:
    quarto render
</code></pre>
<p>Would print the following</p>
<pre><code>just --list
&gt; build # build docs</code></pre>
<p>This is super handy when you have a ton of build instructions.<br />
Importantly there are github actions runners available so they can be used to orchestrate build steps.<br />
See the <a href="https://github.com/casey/just">git repo</a> for more information.<br />
Additionally, I have a neat justfile <a href="https://github.com/medewitt/quarto-blog/blob/main/justfile">here</a>.</p></section><section tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label=" Helper functions needed for Julia
" id="helper-functions-needed-for-julia-2022-10-06"><h1>Helper functions needed for Julia</h1>
<p>There are some really nice packages in R that need Julia ports.<br />
I really have been enjoying using Julia but it reminds me of Base R when I first started using it (e.g., pre-tidyverse).<br />
The easystats suite looks really nice and ripe for a port:</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://github.com/easystats/effectsize/blob/fccb956e20b8cc688dae38abd625b28a760f376e/R/convert_between_OR_to_RR.R">converting between odds ratios</a></p>
<pre><code class="R">oddsratio_to_riskratio.numeric &lt;- function(OR, p0, log = FALSE, ...) {
  if (log) OR &lt;- exp(OR)

  RR &lt;- OR / (1 - p0 + (p0 * OR))

  if (log) RR &lt;- log(RR)
  return(RR)
}</code></pre>
<p>Could be</p>
<pre><code class="language-language-julia">function oddsratio_to_riskratio(OR, p0, log = false)

  if log
    OR = exp(OR)
  end

  RR = OR / (1 - p0 + (p0 * OR))

  if log
    RR = log(RR)
  end

  return RR
end</code></pre></section><section tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label=" Hello, World, Again!
