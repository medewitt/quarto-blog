gghighlight is a package that is on cran that allows one to highlight certain features ones finds valuable. Right now I typically do this with some custom color coding, then pass that into the `ggplot2` arguments. This might serve as a good way to more easily automate this task. Additionally, this could be super handy during exploratory analysis where this is much more iterative to find patterns.

Our libraries of course....

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gghighlight)
```

This code is copied directly from [here](https://yutani.rbind.io/post/2017-10-06-gghighlight/).


Build some data which is more some white noise with a random walk.

```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(2)
d <- purrr::map_dfr(
  letters,
  ~ data.frame(idx = 1:400,
               value = cumsum(runif(400, -1, 1)),
               type = .,
               stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
```

Definitely some messiness and colour overload!

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(d) +
  geom_line(aes(idx, value, colour = type))
```

The way I would do it...

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

d_filtered <- d %>%
  group_by(type) %>% 
  filter(max(value) > 20) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot() +
  # draw the original data series with grey
  geom_line(aes(idx, value, group = type), data = d, colour = alpha("grey", 0.7)) +
  # colourise only the filtered data
  geom_line(aes(idx, value, colour = type), data = d_filtered)
```

Now with this handy package we can do the following:

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(d, aes(idx, value, colour = type))+
	geom_line()+
	gghighlight(max(value) > 20, label_key = type) +
  theme_minimal()
```

And because it is a `ggplot` object we can add things to it.

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(d, aes(idx, value, colour = type))+
	geom_line()+
	gghighlight(max(value) > 20, label_key = type) +
  theme_minimal()+
	facet_wrap(~type)
```



The package author does offer a caveat that the package can run slowly with lots of data and filtering and to go back to using `dplyr` in a discrete step. I imagine it is because of all the grouped operations? Dunno, but this is a neat package to use for exploratory work.
