So I am going to try to use this blog to capture programming tricks and examples of R coding, data visualisation and general musing that I find interesting. This is mainly for personal use and as a nice memory tool.

Below is an example from Claus Wilke's multiscales package. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/clauswilke/multiscales). I like that it uses `geom_sf` and one can also use the value suppressing uncertainty palettes. I often want to communicate uncertainty in cartographic mapping and this provides a much better way to do that. More on that article [here](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2018-UncertaintyPalettes-CHI.pdf).

So now for the example that one can use as...thanks Claus

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(multiscales)
```

```{r echo=TRUE, preview=TRUE}
colors <- scales::colour_ramp(
  colors = c(red = "#AC202F", purple = "#740280", blue = "#2265A3")
)((0:7)/7)

p<-ggplot(US_polling) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = zip(Clinton_lead, moe_normalized)), color = "gray30", size = 0.2) + 
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  bivariate_scale("fill",
    pal_vsup(values = colors, max_desat = 0.8, pow_desat = 0.2, max_light = 0.7, pow_light = 1),
    name = c("Clinton lead", "uncertainty"),
    limits = list(c(-40, 40), c(0, 1)),
    breaks = list(c(-40, -20, 0, 20, 40), c(0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.)),
    labels = list(waiver(), scales::percent),
    guide = "colourfan"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = grid::unit(0.8, "cm"),
    legend.title.align = 0.5,
    plot.margin = margin(5.5, 20, 5.5, 5.5)
  )
p

```
