# ggplot2 latex trick

This is a useful package to use latex notation in {`ggplot2`}. I saw this on twitter and wish I had written down the originator for proper citation but I forgot at the time. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(latex2exp)

example_data <-tibble(ability = seq(-3,3, .1)) %>% 
  mutate(result = plogis(ability*2))

example_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ability, result))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(
    x = TeX("$ability(\\theta)$")
  )+
  theme_bw()
plogis(3)
exp(3)/(1+exp(3))
```
