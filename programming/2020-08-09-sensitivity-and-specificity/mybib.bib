	abstract = {Background: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 based on medically-attended case counts is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions and the wide spectrum of disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys provide one avenue for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic, overcoming many of these limitations.

Methods: Taking advantage of a pool of adult participants from population-representative surveys conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, we implemented a study consisting of 8 weekly serosurveys among these participants and their household members older than 5 years. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Euroimmun AG, Lubeck, Germany). We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. 

Results: In the first three weeks, we enrolled 1335 participants coming from 633 households, with 16\% {\textless}20 years of age and 53.6\% female, a distribution similar to that of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 3.1\% (95\% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343). This increased to 6.1\% (95\% CI 2.6-9.33, n=416) in the second, and to 9.7\% (95\% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third week. We found that 5-19 year-olds (6.0\%, 95\% CI 2.3-10.2\%) had similar seroprevalence to 20-49 year olds (8.5\%, 95\%CI 4.99-11.7), while significantly lower seroprevalence was observed among those 50 and older (3.7\%, 95\% CI 0.99-6.0, p=0.0008).

Interpretation: Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is at least in the short-term associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from burning out simply due to herd immunity. Further, no differences in seroprevalence between children and middle age adults are observed. These results must be considered as Switzerland and the world look towards easing restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.},

Serological surveys are a valuable tool to assess the extent of the epidemic, given the existence of asymptomatic cases and little access to diagnostic tests. This nationwide population-based study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain at national and regional level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}35 883 households were selected from municipal rolls using two-stage random sampling stratified by province and municipality size, with all residents invited to participate. From April 27 to May 11, 2020, 61 075 participants (75·1\% of all contacted individuals within selected households) answered a questionnaire on history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and risk factors, received a point-of-care antibody test, and, if agreed, donated a blood sample for additional testing with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Prevalences of IgG antibodies were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification to allow for differences in non-response rates based on age group, sex, and census-tract income. Using results for both tests, we calculated a seroprevalence range maximising either specificity (positive for both tests) or sensitivity (positive for either test).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Seroprevalence was 5·0\% (95\% CI 4·7–5·4) by the point-of-care test and 4·6\% (4·3–5·0) by immunoassay, with a specificity–sensitivity range of 3·7\% (3·3–4·0; both tests positive) to 6·2\% (5·8–6·6; either test positive), with no differences by sex and lower seroprevalence in children younger than 10 years ({\textless}3·1\% by the point-of-care test). There was substantial geographical variability, with higher prevalence around Madrid ({\textgreater}10\%) and lower in coastal areas ({\textless}3\%). Seroprevalence among 195 participants with positive PCR more than 14 days before the study visit ranged from 87·6\% (81·1–92·1; both tests positive) to 91·8\% (86·3–95·3; either test positive). In 7273 individuals with anosmia or at least three symptoms, seroprevalence ranged from 15·3\% (13·8–16·8) to 19·3\% (17·7–21·0). Around a third of seropositive participants were asymptomatic, ranging from 21·9\% (19·1–24·9) to 35·8\% (33·1–38·5). Only 19·5\% (16·3–23·2) of symptomatic participants who were seropositive by both the point-of-care test and immunoassay reported a previous PCR test.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The majority of the Spanish population is seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in hotspot areas. Most PCR-confirmed cases have detectable antibodies, but a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 did not have a PCR test and at least a third of infections determined by serology were asymptomatic. These results emphasise the need for maintaining public health measures to avoid a new epidemic wave.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Funding{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Spanish Ministry of Health, Institute of Health Carlos III, and Spanish National Health System.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

          , 
            Zika virus is an infectious disease primarily transmitted between people by mosquitoes. While most people develop mild flu-like symptoms, infection during pregnancy can interfere with how the baby’s head and brain develop. Until recently, the virus had only been seen sporadically in Africa and Asia, but since 2007, outbreaks have been recorded on several Pacific islands. In 2015, the Zika virus reached the Americas, and within six months over 1.5 million cases had been reported in Brazil alone.
            There is an urgent need to understand how the Zika virus moves within a population in order to help policymakers, and public health professionals, plan treatment and control of outbreaks of the disease. Researchers often use predictive models to estimate how a disease will spread. A parameter commonly calculated by these models is the “basic reproductive number”, or R0, which represents the average number of additional cases of the disease caused by one infected individual.
            Using models that incorporated data from Zika virus outbreaks that occurred on several Pacific islands, Champagne et al. have produced estimates of R0 that range from 1.5-4.1.
            The R0 values are greater than one, indicating that infection will spread within a population, but in the same range as those obtained for dengue fever, another closely related mosquito-borne disease. This suggests that by taking appropriate measures, the spread of Zika and dengue can be controlled to similar extents.
            A closer look at the relationship between the population size and the predicted R0 value for each Pacific island revealed an unexpected inverse relationship: the smaller the population, the larger the value of R0. Since other regional factors may also explain these large differences between settings, further work is needed to disentangle context-specific from disease-specific factors. In this respect, data about seroprevalence (the number of people whose blood shows evidence of a past infection) in different populations is crucial for precisely analyzing the spread of Zika virus.},

	abstract = {In the Report “[Estimating the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in France][1],” the authors used data from the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship to help calibrate their model. They made the assumption that in addition to the 14 deaths already recorded, the four individuals still in the intensive care unit (ICU) after 2 months would also ultimately die from their infection. This assumption was arrived at after speaking to physicians about long-term outcomes for those in the ICU. However, since the First Release version of this Report was posted, three of those four individuals have left the ICU.

In the final published version of the Report, the authors include this new information. They assume that the one passenger still in the ICU will ultimately die, and they present a sensitivity analysis where this passenger survives. This change reduces their estimates of the infection fatality rate (from 0.65\% down to 0.53\%) and increases the proportion infected on 11 May 2020 (from 4.4\% up to 5.3\%). The estimates of R  and the impact of the lockdown as well as all conclusions are unchanged.
