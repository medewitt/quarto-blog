## Currently

I'm an applied statistician and data scientist working in infectious diseases at [Wake Forest University School of Medicine](https://school.wakehealth.edu/departments/internal-medicine/infectious-diseases) in Winston-Salem, NC. 

<left>
My interests are in: 

* Infectious disease modelling and epidemiology, particularly the detection, surveillance, and dynamics of new and emerging pathogens and how to better inform public health with actionable insights in a timely manor

* Bayesian inference and analytic techniques

* Application of survey analytic techniques (including small area estimation) applied to novel data sets

* Applied machine learning and prediction

* Simulation and optimization

* Causal inference

Additionally, I am an advocate for improving mobility. 
In my spare time I volunteer as a member of the Winston-Salem Transportation Coalition where we advocate for better public transit. 
I employ data science techniques in order to quantify and shed light on the issues. 

You can read more about my work [here](presentations.html). 
Additionally, I maintain a site regarding local politics and economic analysis. 
You can read that [here](https://www.nctriadresearch.com/).

## Before

I came into statistics and data science from chemical engineering (which is what I studied at University). 
I also minored in philosophy and wrote my honors thesis in the English department.

After graduation I worked in industrial engineering at Michelin North America in plant industrial engineering and continuous improvement and at the central level in industrial engineering, project management and decision support and analysis.
